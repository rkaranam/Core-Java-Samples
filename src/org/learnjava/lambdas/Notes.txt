Why Lambdas?

- Enables Functional Programming
- Readable and concise code
- Easier-to-use APIs and libraries
- Enables support for parallel processing

Code in OOP

- Everything is an object
- All code blocks are "associated" with classes and objects

Introduction to Lambdas

- Just like we can pass an inline String value to a method, we
  can pass an "inline" lambda expression too!
  
- When we are using an interface to declare a lambda expression,
  that interface must contain only one method. That method should
  have the same signature as the lambda expression
  
- To execute a lambda expression, we have to call the interface 
  method on it, just as if it were an instance of a class
